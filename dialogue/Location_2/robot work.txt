-You ask but the only answer it says is:

"I'm sorry, Robot have lot of work, Roboto can not help."

-You can see that "Roboto" is working hard
turning on and off the only lamp of his little
planet, it seems that, that is it's work

-So you approach again but ask something different:

        *Tip ask to if you can help*
